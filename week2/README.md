### The Bowling Game Kata ([via Uncle Bob](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata))
	- Create a new project or start in the existing project by adding Game.cs and TestGame.cs
	- Create two public methods methods [refer to the presentation file]
	- Create Test Methods for the above Methods
	- This is called a 'RED' Test as it is going to fail.
	- Rectified both test and class methods
	- Write new test
	- This is called a 'Green' Test as it is going to pass.
	- Rectified TestMethods to meet total 20 frames hit.
	- Rectified test to accept multiple frame and pins
	- Test 3 is a 'Red' test
	- Test 4 and 5 are 'Green'
	- All test passed
	- Still there is scope of refactoring


#### Harry Potter :

	To try and encourage more sales of the 5 different Harry
	Potter books they sell, a bookshop has decided to offer
	discounts of multiple-book purchases.

	One copy of any of the five books costs 8 EUR.

	If, however, you buy two different books, you get a 5%
	discount on those two books.

	If you buy 3 different books, you get a 10% discount.

	If you buy 4 different books, you get a 20% discount.

	If you go the whole hog, and buy all 5, you get a huge 25%
	discount.

	Note that if you buy, say, four books, of which 3 are
	different titles, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that
	form part of a set, but the fourth book still costs 8 EUR.

	Your mission is to write a piece of code to calculate the
	price of any conceivable shopping basket (containing only
	Harry Potter books), giving as big a discount as possible.

	For example, how much does this basket of books cost?

	2 copies of the first book
	2 copies of the second book
	2 copies of the third book
	1 copy of the fourth book
	1 copy of the fifth book

	Answer: 51.60 EUR



#### Mine Fields :

	A field of N x M squares is represented by N lines of
	exactly M characters each. The character '*' represents
	a mine and the character '.' represents no-mine.

	Example input (a 4 x 3 mine-field of 12 squares, 2 of
	which are mines)

	4 3
	*...
	..*.
	....

	Your task is to write a program to accept this input and
	produce as output a hint-field of identical dimensions
	where each square is a * for a mine or the number of
	adjacent mine-squares if the square does not contain a mine.

	Example output (for the above input)
	*211
	12*1
	0111
