#### Harry Potter :

	To try and encourage more sales of the 5 different Harry
	Potter books they sell, a bookshop has decided to offer
	discounts of multiple-book purchases.

	One copy of any of the five books costs 8 EUR.

	If, however, you buy two different books, you get a 5%
	discount on those two books.

	If you buy 3 different books, you get a 10% discount.

	If you buy 4 different books, you get a 20% discount.

	If you go the whole hog, and buy all 5, you get a huge 25%
	discount.

	Note that if you buy, say, four books, of which 3 are
	different titles, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that
	form part of a set, but the fourth book still costs 8 EUR.

	Your mission is to write a piece of code to calculate the
	price of any conceivable shopping basket (containing only
	Harry Potter books), giving as big a discount as possible.

	For example, how much does this basket of books cost?

	2 copies of the first book
	2 copies of the second book
	2 copies of the third book
	1 copy of the fourth book
	1 copy of the fifth book

	Answer: 51.60 EUR
